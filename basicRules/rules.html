            <h2 style="color: #2b59c3;">Skill Rolls</h2>
            <p>
                The word "roll" is used in conjunction with the appropriate skill or characteristic; 
                thus the Keeper will, for example, call for a "Climb roll" or a "Strength roll". The Keeper 
                has the final say about which skill or characteristic is appropriate to roll, depending 
                on the situation and the nature of the opposition. The term "skill roll" is used regardless 
                of whether a skill or a characteristic is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player should be clear about what they want to achieve by stating a goal before 
                rolling any dice. If the goal isn’t acceptable, the Keeper should help the player to 
                rephrase it. The goal should define the player’s objective clearly and concisely.

            <h3 style="color: #2b59c3;">Determining Difficulty Level</h3>
            <p>
                The Keeper determines the difficulty level for skill rolls. There are three levels of difficulty 
                in Call of Cthulhu: <strong>Regular</strong>, <strong>Hard</strong>, and <strong>Extreme</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Regular difficulty level:</strong> An average example of what would challenge a competent 
                person. The player needs to roll equal to or below their full skill or characteristic in order 
                to succeed. This should be used in the vast majority of cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hard difficulty level:</strong> This task would challenge a professional. The player needs to 
                roll equal to or below half of their skill or characteristic in order to succeed. This should only 
                be used occasionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Extreme difficulty level:</strong> This task would challenge an expert; it is on the border of 
                what is humanly possible. The player needs to roll equal to or below a fifth of their skill or 
                characteristic in order to succeed. This should be reserved for extreme situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you, as Keeper, feel that the task is easy, then don’t ask for a dice roll. Save dice rolls for 
                challenging situations. If the investigator is facing a living being, the difficulty level should 
                be set according to the complementary skill or characteristic belonging to that being 
                (human or otherwise). It is up to the Keeper to decide which skill or characteristic would be used 
                by the opponent to counter the investigator’s actions.
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular:</strong> If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is below 50.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard:</strong> If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is equal to or above 50.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme:</strong> If the opponent’s skill or characteristic is equal to or above 90.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                In the case of non-living opponents, the Keeper must act as judge, weighing up the pertinent factors. 
                A standard challenge would be of Regular difficulty. Where the challenge is clearly beyond Regular 
                difficulty, the Keeper may use the Hard difficulty level. If the challenge is exceptionally difficult 
                but still within the bounds of what is humanly possible, the Keeper should use the Extreme difficulty level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wherever possible, the situation should be framed in such a way that the dice are being rolled by the player. 
                Players won’t get much fun out of watching the Keeper roll the dice every time. For example:
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the investigator is attempting to use their Stealth skill to furtively follow a non-player 
                    character, the player would roll the dice, and the Keeper would use the non-player character’s 
                    Spot Hidden skill to set the difficulty level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the situation were reversed and the non-player character were following the investigator, the player 
                    would roll the dice against their Spot Hidden skill to see if the tail is spotted. This time the Keeper 
                    would use the non-player character’s Stealth skill to set the difficulty level.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                Remember, the players should be rolling the dice more often than the Keeper.

            <h3 style="color: #2b59c3;">Rolling the Dice: Success or Failure</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two possible outcomes of a roll: success or failure. The various divisions of skill (fifth, half, full) 
                    do not equate with graduations of success. The player states a goal and then rolls the dice. If the dice roll is 
                    equal to or below the required number, the goal is fully achieved. However, if the roll is below a half or a fifth 
                    of the specified skill, it does not necessarily mean the goal is performed to a higher standard. Any further 
                    interpretation of the roll is at the discretion of the Keeper.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: #f48c06;">Success</h4>
                <p>
                    If the player rolls equal to or under the target set by the Keeper, their investigator has achieved the goal agreed upon 
                    before the roll. Players should be encouraged to participate in describing the outcome, which can include aspects of the 
                    story beyond their investigator, such as the actions of non-player characters or environmental changes. The Keeper moderates 
                    these descriptions, ensuring both player and Keeper are involved in narrating the success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, Harvey fails to persuade the librarian and decides to force open the library's back door. Harvey's STR is 20, and the 
                    Keeper judges the thick oak door to be particularly strong, setting the difficulty to Hard. This requires Harvey's player to roll 
                    10 or below (half of Harvey's STR).
                </p>
                <h4 style="color: #f48c06;">Failure</h4>
                <p>
                    When a player fails to achieve their stated goal, the Keeper determines how the investigator failed. Players may suggest outcomes, 
                    but the final decision lies with the Keeper. Typically, failure does not result in damage or Sanity loss unless the circumstances 
                    dictate otherwise. A failed roll can represent a failure to act rather than an active failed attempt. Consequences for pushed rolls 
                    (see below) should be reserved for "what’s the worst that could happen?" moments.
                </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 style="color: #2b59c3;">Pushing the Roll</h2>
            <p>
                A pushed roll allows the player a second and final attempt to achieve a goal. To justify a pushed roll, the player must describe 
                the extra effort or risk involved. The Keeper asks, “What action are you taking to push the situation?” Other players or the Keeper 
                may suggest ideas if the player is stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
                By pushing a roll, the player accepts the possibility of severe consequences if the second roll fails. The Keeper gains license to 
                impose dire outcomes that align with the theme of horror, steering the investigators closer to their doom.
            </p>
            <h3 style="color: #f48c06;">Examples of Pushed Rolls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Breaking down a door might mean throwing yourself at it without regard for safety.</li>
                <li>Persuading a police officer might mean risking arrest.</li>
                <li>Searching a room could mean breaking things or spending too much time there, risking discovery.</li>
                <li>Using Psychology might involve asking overly prying questions.</li>
                <li>Picking a lock could mean using too much force, risking broken tools or a damaged lock.</li>
                <li>Climbing a wall might mean continuing despite it being unsafe.</li>
                <li>Reading a tome could lead to obsessive behavior, risking mental stability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Pushed rolls are not simple re-rolls; time passes between attempts, and the situation must justify the roll. Only skill and characteristic 
                rolls can be pushed—Luck, Sanity, and combat rolls cannot.

        <section>
            <h2 style="color: #2b59c3;">Foreshadowing Failure</h2>
            <p>
                Before a pushed roll, the Keeper may foreshadow the consequences of failure, describing potential dangers apparent to the investigator. 
                This raises the drama and helps players gauge the risks. Players are also encouraged to offer scarier suggestions for failure.

            <h2 style="color: #2b59c3;">Pushed Roll Outcomes</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #f48c06;">Success</h3>
            <p>The goal is achieved, and none of the consequences of failure occur.</p>
            <h3 style="color: #f48c06;">Failure</h3>
            <p>
                Failing a pushed roll allows the Keeper to introduce serious consequences, such as damage, Sanity loss, equipment failure, capture, or isolation. 
                These outcomes steer the story deeper into horror and further the narrative, rather than ending the game prematurely.

            <h2 style="color: #2b59c3;">Multiple Players Rolling Dice</h2>
            <p>
                When two or more players work together towards the same goal, the Keeper determines how many investigators can participate in the roll. 
                Collaboration adds to the drama and strategy of the game.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h4 style="color: #2b59c3;">01: Critical Success</h4>
            <p>A roll of 01 means something beneficial occurs beyond simply achieving the goal. The nature of the good fortune is at the Keeper’s discretion, although players may suggest ideas. In combat, for example, a critical success means hitting a vulnerable spot and causing maximum damage.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4 style="color: #2b59c3;">96–100: Fumble</h4>
            <p>A fumble means something really bad occurs—worse than a straight failure. The Keeper decides the nature of the misfortune:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If success requires 50% or more and the dice read 100, a fumble has occurred.</li>
                <li>If success requires less than 50% and the dice read 96–100, a fumble has occurred.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h4 style="color: #2b59c3;">Luck</h4>
            <p>Luck rolls are called by the Keeper to determine external circumstances or the hand of fate. If a skill or characteristic is applicable, it should be used instead of Luck. In group rolls, the player with the lowest Luck score rolls. The Keeper may also use the lowest score to determine who suffers misfortune.</p>
        </section>

            <h4 style="color: #2b59c3;">Intelligence and Idea Rolls</h4>
            <h5 style="color: #f48c06;">Intelligence</h5>
            <p>Intelligence (INT) rolls solve intellectual puzzles. Success provides the solution from the Keeper.</p>
            <h5 style="color: #f48c06;">Idea</h5>
            <p>Idea rolls are used when players are stuck in the investigation. Success gives clues, while failure provides them at a cost.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #2b59c3;">Opposed Rolls</h4>
            <p>When two characters oppose each other, they roll dice to determine the victor. The levels of success are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fumble</li>
                <li>Failure</li>
                <li>Regular Success</li>
                <li>Hard Success</li>

                <li>Critical Success</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The highest success wins. In case of a tie, the character with the higher skill wins. If still tied, both re-roll.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #2b59c3;">Skill Improvement</h4>
            <p>When an investigator successfully uses a skill, check the box beside that skill on the investigator sheet. No tick is earned if a bonus die was used. Only the winner of an opposed roll may tick their skill.</p>
            <p>During the investigator development phase, roll 1D100 for each checked skill. If the roll exceeds the skill level or is over 95, add 1D10 to the skill. If not, the skill remains unchanged. Erase all checks afterward.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Cthulhu Mythos and Credit Rating skills never receive checks.</p>
